Trump is at minimum a sex pest, possibly a pedophile:

 * * "The Trump campaign did not offer a response to either story, but in a 2005 appearance on Howard Stern’s show, Trump bragged about doing exactly what the women describe. “I’ll go backstage before a show, and everyone’s getting dressed and ready and everything else. And you know, no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because you know I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. ...And you see these incredible looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that."

 * he CONSTANTLY talks about how he wants to fuck his daughter

And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”"

Trump is a fascist:
