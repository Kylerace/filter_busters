Trump is at minimum a sex pest, possibly a pedophile:

 * * "The Trump campaign did not offer a response to either story, but in a 2005 appearance on Howard Stern’s show, Trump bragged about doing exactly what the women describe. “I’ll go backstage before a show, and everyone’s getting dressed and ready and everything else. And you know, no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because you know I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. ...And you see these incredible looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that."

 * he CONSTANTLY talks about how he wants to fuck his daughter
 * * "I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diMp241gAcw)
 * * [on Ivanka] “Yeah, she’s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father...” (http://web.archive.org/web/20180808113949/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-seriously-on-the-trail-with-the-gops-tough-guy-41447/)
 
 
 * he was friends with Jeffery Epstein 
 * * "Epstein likes to tell people that he’s a loner, a man who’s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”" (https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/)

Trump is a fascist:
 * (referring to kim jong un): "he speaks and his people sit up at attention I want my people to do the same" (https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2612824168737597)
 * Trump explicitly believes in eugenics
 * * “You know, now a murderer, I believe this, it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. They left, they had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn’t be here, that are criminals.” (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-suggests-immigrants-bad-genes-latest-disparagement-migrants-rcna174271, https://youtu.be/8Wh-6ZabvpI?t=76) TODO: find audio sources
 * * * “You have good genes. You know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? The racehorse theory. You think we’re so different? You have good genes in Minnesota” (https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1148661612299703)
 * * * "They're poisoning the blood of our country. That's what they've done, they've poisoned mental institutions and prisons all over the world" (https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5098439/donald-trump-illegal-immigrants-poisoning-blood-country)
 * * * "I have a certain gene. I'm a gene believer. Hey, when you connect two race horses, you usually end up with a fast horse. And I really was -- you know, I had a -- a good gene pool from the standpoint of that." (http://web.archive.org/web/20200923175255/https://us.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1002/10/ctw.01.html)

Trump lies as he breathes: 
 * He brandishes christianity and yet in any interview that touches on it he shows himself to have obviously never read the bible once.
 * * cannot cite a favorite verse when asked directly, when asked about the old and new testament dodges the question. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERUngQUCsyE

Trump is senile and is rapidly declining mentally:
 

Trump is a traitor:
 * TODO: jan 6th
 * Trump's former VP Pence: "I want the american people to know that I had no right to overturn the election. And that on that day President Trump asked me to put him over the constitution. But I chose the constituion. ... Anyone who puts themselves over the constitution should never be president of the united states. And anyone who asked anyone else to put themselves over the constitution should never be president of the united states again." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x0jrosGBYY)

Trumps policies would be a fucking disaster:
