Trump is at minimum a sex pest, possibly a pedophile:

 * * "The Trump campaign did not offer a response to either story, but in a 2005 appearance on Howard Stern’s show, Trump bragged about doing exactly what the women describe. “I’ll go backstage before a show, and everyone’s getting dressed and ready and everything else. And you know, no men are anywhere. And I'm allowed to go in because you know I'm the owner of the pageant and therefore I'm inspecting it. ...And you see these incredible looking women, and so I sort of get away with things like that."

 * he CONSTANTLY talks about how he wants to fuck his daughter
 * * "I've said that if Ivanka weren't my daughter perhaps I'd be dating her." (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diMp241gAcw)
 * * [on Ivanka] “Yeah, she’s really something, and what a beauty, that one. If I weren’t happily married and, ya know, her father...” (http://web.archive.org/web/20180808113949/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-seriously-on-the-trail-with-the-gops-tough-guy-41447/)
 
 
 * he was friends with Jeffery Epstein (https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/)
 * * "Epstein likes to tell people that he’s a loner, a man who’s never touched alcohol or drugs, and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a different Epstein emerges. “I’ve known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump booms from a speakerphone. “He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life.”"

Trump is a fascist:
 * (referring to kim jong un): "he speaks and his people sit up at attention I want my people to do the same" (https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2612824168737597)
 * Trump explicitly believes in eugenics
 * * “You know, now a murderer, I believe this, it’s in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. They left, they had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn’t be here, that are criminals.” (https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-suggests-immigrants-bad-genes-latest-disparagement-migrants-rcna174271, https://youtu.be/8Wh-6ZabvpI?t=76) TODO: find audio sources
 * * * “You have good genes. You know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? The racehorse theory. You think we’re so different? You have good genes in Minnesota” (https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1148661612299703)
 * * * "poisoning the blood of our country" (https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5098439/donald-trump-illegal-immigrants-poisoning-blood-country)
