# filter_busters
A collection of clearly stated and sourced arguments why Donald Trump should not be elected president. Ideally useful even against those that have created a mental filter blocking criticisms of Donald Trump.

Since his nomination as the republican presidential candidate in 2015 Donald Trump has mentally DDOS'd the American people. He creates so much negative press about him constantly that it becomes impossible to remember it all. People get used to the constant background noise of Trump doing what would be indefensible and career ending to any other politician and from that constant normalization process those that stand against Donald Trump find what should be reasonable arguments from recent events falling flat, and those not against Donald Trump create a mental filter blocking most such arguments. Because of this approximately 50% of the American people are set to vote for Donald Trump again in the 2024 presidential election.

This repository is not meant to create a singular cohesive argument for why Donald Trump should not be elected as president again. It is meant to create a list of arguments ranked according to how effectively they can pierce any mental filters blocking criticism of Donald Trump. 

Everything must be sourced. Heavily prefer primary sources over secondary sources (and video/audio over text) because one of the main filters to pierce is distrust of the media, which doesn't apply to direct quotes (especially recordings) of Donald Trump for example. There is no bibliography, just paste the links you're using directly after the quote. 

Arguments are provided in the following format:
[statement]:
 * support of that statement (source)
 * * support of that statement, if necessary
 * * * ...
 
 * other support of that statement (source)
